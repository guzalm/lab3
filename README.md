STEP 1: First of all, I created a new public class named MyLinkedListStack for the MyLinkedList implementation. 

STEP 2: After, to continue work with Stack, I imported the necessary class: java.util.EmptyStackException for the stack exception.

STEP 3: now, I declared an instance variable "list" of type MyLinkedList inside the class, by using private MyLinkedList<T> list;.

STEP 4:There was created a constructor for the class and initialize the instance variable "list" inside MyLinkedListStack() by using "new" operator.
  
STEP 5:To implement the push method that adds an element to the top of the stack using the addFirst method for MyLinkedList in the MyLinkedListStack class, I added the code, by using the push() method takes an element of type T and adds it to the top of the stack using the addFirst() method of the list object.
