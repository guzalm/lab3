STEP 1: First of all, I created a new public class named MyLinkedListStack for the MyLinkedList implementation. 
STEP 2: After, to continue work with Stack, I imported the necessary class: java.util.EmptyStackException for the stack exception.
STEP 3: now, I declared an instance variable "list" of type MyLinkedList inside the class, by using private MyLinkedList<T> list;.
